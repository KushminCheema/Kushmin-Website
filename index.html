        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Medical Internist</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Having lived a life firmly linked to his roots and always striving to learn, Kushmin Cheema, is above all, passionate about anatomy, physiology, pathology, nature, and life. Driven by a willingness to learn, a  drive to apply, and a strong sense of curiosity, Cheema has and always strived to live a life that is full of as many experiences as he can go through and endeavors to apply his knowledge to as many areas of interest as he can. Having a natural curiosity for all things since birth, and an eventually acquired knack for being able to tinker with things has driven him to delve into such interests as cooking, automobile restoration, sailing, economics, residential construction, and computer programming. With task independence always an instilled quality, Cheema is greatly fulfilled in being able to help people solve issues while teaching skills in the process.<br><br>

       To this end, Cheema’s continual drive to learn how things operate, how to troubleshoot issues, and to ensure that things can be improved upon have all contributed to his ultimate interest: the health sciences. As a soon-to-be graduate of the University of California in Riverside, majoring in biochemistry has underscored the importance of how everything from atoms to cells to organ systems work together mechanically and the effects of their dysfunction. With this knowledge one can begin the unenviable task of educating the public when it comes to issues such as diabetes, obesity, how vaccinations work, genetic issues, eye health, and the staggering amount of health misinformation that has permeated social media. <br><br>

        After graduating with a degree in Biochemistry with a medical emphasis, Cheema will endeavor to attend medical school and may even entertain pursuing a masters degree in genetic counseling. Again, areas of interest are macromolecules and their effects on biological tissue, resulting impact on organ systems and how we can use our knowledge to promote one’s better overall health.<br><br>
        
        Since graduating from high school, Cheema attended the University of California, Davis campus before having to withdraw in order to support his family. Working in both construction, property management, and as a caretaker for several years at various locations in the Bay Area before returning to higher education. In his spare time he volunteers at a clinic that specializes in cardiology and cosmetic procedures where he continually learns the importance of <br><br>
        
        In his spare time, Cheema likes to apply what he has learned in regards to biochemistry to his chief hobby: the culinary arts. Having a solid understanding of protein interactions and macromolecule behavior in general is quite conducive to baking bread, curing or smoking various meats, creating sauces, brewing, and the distillation of spirits. Cheema’s favorite rooms of a house are the kitchen and the garage. He dreams of one day owning a house and doing all of the remodeling himself, as well as having a car and maybe even a motorcycle that he is working on.<br><br>
        
        When he isn’t learning, Cheema enjoys hiking (especially around any sort of Botanical gardens), long dramas, sailing, and science fiction. He has a strong dislike for sleep, even though he admits it’s necessary.
